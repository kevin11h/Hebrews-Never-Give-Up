Hebrews 13:5 New International Version (NIV)
5 Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said,

“Never will I leave you;
    never will I forsake you.”[a]
    
    
 Hebrews 10:25 New International Version (NIV)
**25 not giving up meeting together**, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
